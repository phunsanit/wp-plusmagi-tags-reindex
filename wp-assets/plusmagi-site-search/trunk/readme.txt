Replace the default WordPress search with fast Ajax live search, deeper custom fields indexing, and more relevant internal search results.

== Description ==

Is the default WordPress search missing important content or slowing users down?

PlusMagi Site Search is a lightweight, high-performance search replacement built to improve internal search accuracy with Ajax live search, cleaner result presentation, and deeper indexing across posts, pages, categories, tags, and custom fields.

It is especially useful for content-heavy websites, internal knowledge bases, membership sites, and WooCommerce stores that need visitors to find the right content quickly. Role-based filtering helps keep restricted results visible only to the right users, while public visitors get a fast and secure search experience.

If you need a custom search plugin that goes beyond native WordPress search, PlusMagi Site Search helps surface hidden content, supports WooCommerce SKU-style metadata search, and keeps the search experience fast and easy to scan.

== Features ==

*   **Ajax Live Search**: Instant search results with zero page refreshes.
*   **Smart Access Control**: Filters results for Public, Authors, and Admins dynamically.
*   **Deep Search Capability**:
	*   Post Titles and Content.
	*   Custom Fields (meta data like SKUs and internal codes).
	*   Taxonomies (Categories and Tags).
*   **Organized Search Results**: Results are grouped into Posts, Category, and Tag tabs.
*   **Visual Enhancements**: Shows featured images (thumbnails) in the search dropdown.
*   **Advanced Search Filters**: Use prefixes like `post:`, `tag:`, or `category:`.
*   **Developer Friendly**: Supports shortcode `[plusmagi-site-search]` and Block Editor.
*   **High Performance**: Optimized with lightweight Ajax calls.
*   **WordPress 7.0 Ready**: Fully tested and optimized for WordPress 7.0 and PHP 7.4+.
